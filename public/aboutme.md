# Expected 🤔

Here, I will documenting what I learn and everything I want to summarize (books, issues, thoughts). If you've come across my website because you were searching for something on Google. I will appreciate it (because you probably encountered something that I have dealt with before).

# Why did I build this?
---
A couple years ago, When I was an EE student, I read a lot of personal blog that built by talented individuals(I will share some of the blogs I love at the bottom of this page, by the way). They share their perspectives, which were too long to put on the social media (like IG)🥺, I learned that this is a valuable way to convey what I think and learn because there are people who don't want to see a long page of someone's views on something on social media. So, I built this website to store my history of thoughts and hope my posts can help someone who struggles with things that I have encountered before, just like I was helped by other blogs I read 🎉🎉.
