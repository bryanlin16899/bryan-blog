# Expected 🤔

Here, I will documenting what I learn and everything I want to summarize (books, issues, thoughts). If you've come across my website because you were searching for something on Google. I will appreciate it (because you probably encountered something that I have dealt with before).

# Why did I build this?
---
A couple years ago, When I was an EE student, I read a lot of personal blog that built by talented individuals(I will share some of the blogs I love at the bottom of this page, by the way). They share thier perspectives, which were too long to put on the social media (like IG), I learned that this is valuable way to convey what I think and learn because there are people who don't want to see a long page of someone's views on something on social media.
